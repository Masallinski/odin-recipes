	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>Hatch chiles are in season for only eight weeks a year, 10 weeks if the weather is extra warm. Our local markets roast and sell them in 25-pound boxes.</p>
	<p>We buy 50 pounds every year, package them, and freeze them.This flavorful Hatch chile chicken recipe can be served in tortillas, over rice, or by itself.</p>

	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>5 Hatch chile peppers</li>
		<li>1 ½ tablespoons butter</li>
		<li>1 onion, cut into strips</li>
		<li>1 cup frozen corn</li>
		<li>¾ tablespoon chicken bouillon granules</li>
		<li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
		<li>1 ½ cups shredded rotisserie chicken</li>
		<li>1 cup Mexican crema</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Steps</h3>
